Comparators are used to compare two objects. create a comparator and use it to sort an array. 

There is a  Player class, It has two fields:<br>
name: a string <br>
score: an integer

Given an array of  Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. If  or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name.

Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. <br>
Once sorted, print the following three lines:

* Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps., where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
* First Element: firstElement, where  is the first element in the sorted array.
* Last Element: lastElement, where  is the last element in the sorted array.

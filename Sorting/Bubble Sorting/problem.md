# Bubble Sort Algorithm - Array Sorting

Given an array of integers, we will sort the array in ascending order using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. After sorting the array, we will print the following three lines:

1. **Array is sorted in `numSwaps` swaps.**

   - Where `numSwaps` is the total number of swaps that took place during the sorting process.

2. **First Element: `firstElement`**

   - This will be the first element in the sorted array.

3. **Last Element: `lastElement`**
   - This will be the last element in the sorted array.

### Example

If we have an unsorted array:

```plaintext
[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]
```

Array is sorted in 3 swaps.  
First Element: 1  
Last Element: 6

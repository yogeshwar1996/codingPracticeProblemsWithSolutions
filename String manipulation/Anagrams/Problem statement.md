# Problem statement
Two strings are anagrams of each other if the first string's letters can be rearranged to form the second string.

Given two strings, S1 and S2 that may or may not be of the same length, determine the minimum number of character deletions required to make  S1 and S2 anagrams. Any characters can be deleted from either of the strings

## Example
S1 = 'cde'
S2 = 'dcf'

Deleting e from S1 and f from S2 makes the remaining string 'cd' and 'dc' anagrams
